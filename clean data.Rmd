# Audience and Purpose

The purpose of our project is to help Mr. Kirk Bogard raise funds for Farmer School of Business. We will create several maps to clearly show companies in regions where it is valuable to try to build external relationships. The audience of our project are shared work producers including the team of people who do the same job as Mr. Kirk Bogard, users who need to know how it is done, and how to do it better.

# Value Proposition

![](poster%20Value%20proposition%20canvas%20simple%20white.png)

## Data Description

Our group will be using the FSB data on the employment status of graduates in order to find information about geographic trends. The data file includes survey data on where students are going, what students' salaries are, and job opportunities in different regions between 2019 to 2021.

# Documented Code to Clean Data

The code was originally written in python in a secure FSB Jupyter Server and translated to be used in R studio.

##### The necessary libraries are loaded into R {.unnumbered}

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

##### The data is loaded and displayed to check the success of the loading {.unnumbered}

```{r}
df <- readRDS('FSB_BI_Survey_2019_2021.rds')
head(df)
```

##### Missing values are evaluated {.unnumbered}

```{r}
colSums(is.na(df))
```

##### Variables are removed due to lack of understanding, missing values, and relevance {.unnumbered}

```{r}
# Variables "BBRJ", "Study Abroad Courtesy Account", and "Transfer Work" are removed due to lack of understanding and missing variables

df <- df[, !(names(df) %in% c("BBRJ","Study Abroad Courtesy Account", "Transfer Work (Pre-Banner)"))]

# Variables without relevance to the research question are removed

df <- df[, !(names(df) %in% c("nmajor", "Business Direct Admit", "First Generation College Stdnt", "Combined Bacc and Masters", "Dean's List", "FSB Scholars", "Honors Program", "President's List", "Cum Laude", "Magna Cum Laude", "Summa Cum Laude", "University Honors","UniversityHonors w/Distinction", "year.x", "latin_honors", "survey_gradprogram", "survey_gradschool", "survey_internfour","survey_internone", "survey_internships", "survey_internthree", "survey_interntwo"))]
```

##### The data is displayed again and the dimensions are checked to confirm removal of variables {.unnumbered}

```{r}
head(df)
dim(df)
```

##### Rows that contain a null value for "survey_state" are removed {.unnumbered}

```{r}
df <- df[!is.na(df$survey_state), , drop = FALSE]
```

##### The data is checked for remaining null values {.unnumbered}

```{r}
str(df)
```

##### Null values are imputed {.unnumbered}

```{r}
# Missing values in variables 'survey_city', 'survey_company', and 'survey_deptfunc' are imputed with "Unknown"

df[, c("survey_city", "survey_company", "survey_deptfunc")] <- lapply(df[, c("survey_city", "survey_company", "survey_deptfunc")], function(x) ifelse(is.na(x), "Unknown", x))

# Missing values in variables 'survey_offers', 'survey_pref_field', and 'survey_pref_loc' are imputed with "None"

df[, c("survey_offers", "survey_pref_field", "survey_pref_loc")] <- lapply(df[, c("survey_offers", "survey_pref_field", "survey_pref_loc")], function(x) ifelse(is.na(x), "None", x))

# The missing values in the 'survey_salary' variable are imputed with the mean salary

df$survey_salary[is.na(df$survey_salary)] <- mean(df$survey_salary, na.rm = TRUE)
```

##### The data is checked for remaining null values {.unnumbered}

```{r}
str(df)
```

##### The modified data is saved to a new CSV file {.unnumbered}

```{r}
write.csv(df, file = "FSB_Survey.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

# Explanation of Cleaning the Data

We started by getting an overview the data structure and missing values for each variable. Then, we deleted several variables which do not relate to our project or are not clear enough to be useful, including BBRJ, Study Abroad Courtesy Account, Transfer Work, latin_honors and 25 others. We deleted these variables because they were not relevant to our research question. We then removed the rows that contained missing values for the state the job was in, as no information could be gathered for the project without this information. . For some variables such as 'survey_offers', 'survey_cities' we imputed them with "Unknown" or "None" to make clear the meaning of the null values. We also imputed the salary with the mean in preparation for the possibility of using that variable for further analysis requiring numeric data. Finally, we exported the cleaned data into "FSB_Survey.csv" in order to use for future analysis.

# Computing Environment

```{r}
R.Version()
```

We ran the code R.Version（）to determine the version of r studio used to ensure our code can be reproduced. We have also saved our original file "FSB_BI_Survey_2019_2021.rds". Thus, we can rerun the code in the future to ensure reproducibility.
